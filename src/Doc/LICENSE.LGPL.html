<br>GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<p>Version 2, June 1991
<p>Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br>59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307, USA
<br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<p>[This is the first released version of the library GPL.&nbsp; It is
<br>&nbsp;numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
<p>Preamble
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are
<br>intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
make sure the software is free for all its users.
<p>This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially
designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries
<br>whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries,
too.
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
<br>freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that
<br>you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
and that you know you can do these things.
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
<br>restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library, or if you modify it.
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must
<br>make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you
link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files
to the
<br>recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these
terms so
<br>they know their rights.
<p>Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the
library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission
to copy,
<br>distribute and/or modify the library.
<p>Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If
the library
<br>is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems
<br>introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will
<br>individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the
program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear
that any
<br>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at
all.
<p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.
<br>This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be
<br>sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the
same as in the ordinary license.
<p>The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to
a
<br>program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous
<br>to running a utility program or application program. However, in a
textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative
of
<br>the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats
it as such.
<p>Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public
License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because
most
<br>developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions
might promote sharing better.
<p>However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries
<br>themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit
developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving
your
<br>freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that
are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards
<br>changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes
in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead
to faster
<br>development of free libraries.
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on
<br>the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains
code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with
the library.
<p>Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
<br>MODIFICATION
<p>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying
it
<br>may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License
(also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<p>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared
so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some
<br>of those functions and data) to form executables.
<p>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which
has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library"
<br>means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either
verbatim or
<br>with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
term
<br>"modification".)
<p>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the
<br>source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the
<br>library.
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
a program
<br>using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
(independent
<br>of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is
true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the
Library
<br>does.
<p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
<br>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
that
<br>refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute
a copy of this License along with the Library.
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute
such
<br>modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The modified work must itself be a software
library.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause the files modified to carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any
change.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must cause the whole of the work to
be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If a facility in the modified Library refers
to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program
that uses the facility, other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the
event an application does
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not supply such function or table, the facility
still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; function in a library to compute square roots
has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.
Therefore, Subsection
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2d requires that any application-supplied
function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application
does not supply it, the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; square root function must still compute square
roots.)
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
<br>reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
<br>distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
<br>distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
each and
<br>every part regardless of who wrote it.
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
the right to
<br>control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Library.
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
<br>storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
<p>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this,
<br>you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that
they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead
of to this
<br>License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead
if
<br>you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
<p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent
<br>copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
Library into a program that is not a library.
<p>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
of
<br>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
<br>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
for software interchange.
<p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from
a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code
<br>from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source
code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along
with
<br>the object code.
<p>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with
it, is
<br>called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is
not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope
of this
<br>License.
<p>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates
an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
portions
<br>of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable
is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
<br>of such executables.
<p>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative
<br>work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this
is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the
Library, or if
<br>the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is
not precisely defined by law.
<p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten
lines or
<br>less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless
of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this
object
<br>code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
<br>containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they
are linked directly with the Library itself.
<p>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link
a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing
<br>portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your
choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the
<br>customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
<p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
<br>You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution
displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the
Library
<br>among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of
this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes
were
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used in the work (which must be distributed
under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; complete machine-readable "work that uses
the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify
the Library and then
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relink to produce a modified executable containing
the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents
of definitions
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; files in the Library will not necessarily
be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the work with a written offer,
valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified
in Subsection 6a,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; above, for a charge no more than the cost
of performing this distribution.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If distribution of the work is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy
the above specified
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials from the same place.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Verify that the user has already received
a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library"
must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the
<br>executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
either
<br>source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
that
<br>component itself accompanies the executable.
<p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions
of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
<br>system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
Library together in an executable that you distribute.
<p>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities
not covered
<br>by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
<br>library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
these two things:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy
of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities. This
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined
library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and
explaining where to find the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<p>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
<br>to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However,
<br>parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License
will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain
in full
<br>compliance.
<p>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
the
<br>Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law
if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the
<br>Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
<br>distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
<p>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor
<br>to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these
terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
<br>recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
<p>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are
<br>imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
the
<br>conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
<br>obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library
at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
<br>redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it
and this
<br>License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply, and the
<br>section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
claims; this
<br>section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.
Many
<br>people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of
that
<br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
that
<br>choice.
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<p>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright
<br>holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution
<br>is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
of this
<br>License.
<p>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later
<br>version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
<br>Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
<p>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write
to the
<br>author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
<br>sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by
the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
software
<br>and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<p>NO WARRANTY
<p>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT
<br>PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
<br>INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br>PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
<br>LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<p>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,
<br>OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO
<br>YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT
<br>OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO
<br>OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
<br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
